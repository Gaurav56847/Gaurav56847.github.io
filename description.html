        <h3>Plastic: an environmental hazard</h3>
    
        <p>Synthetic plastics have become an inevitable part of modern life due to their many desirable characteristics. However, accumulation of synthetic plastics wastes in the environment is now a major global problem because these materials are recalcitrant to natural biodegradation processes (Mohanan et al., 2020).
            <br><br>
            Petroleum-derived (petro-)polymers such as polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PU), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) have been extensively utilized in a wide-range of industrial and domestic applications and are extremely recalcitrant to natural biodegradation pathways (Mohanan et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2008).
<br><br>
However, some microorganisms with the ability to degrade petro-polymers under in vitro conditions have been isolated and characterized. In some cases, the enzymes expressed by these microbes have been cloned and sequenced. Microbial and enzymatic degradation of waste petro-plastics is a promising strategy for depolymerization of waste petro-plastics into polymer monomers for recycling, or to covert waste plastics into higher value bioproducts, such as biodegradable polymers via mineralization (Mohanan et al., 2020).
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Creation of PlastiVolt </h3>
        <p>Realizing the immense potential of the microbial degradation of synthetic plastics into monomers for recycling or other higher value bioproducts, which then enter various metabolic processes, led us to explore the possiblities of using this process to harness certain products like lactase. This lactate can then be used as substrate by an electricity-producing bacteria like <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i>. 
<br><br>Here, we would specially like to mention that the inspiration for producing electricity from plastic was taken from the project “Starchlight” by Ionis Paris iGEM 2022 team. Instead of a synthetic plastic, the team had used brewers’ spent grain as substrate for production of lactate andpolylactate (PLA).
<br><br>Thus, by biodegrading and eventually converting a suitable plastic such as polyethylene terphthalate (PET) into polylactate, we plan to build a microbial fuel cell (MFC). The fuel for this MFC will be PET. For a more detailed description, let’s take a deep dive.

            <h3>The Scientific Background of Plastigrade</h3>
            <p>Polymer chains are broken by enzymes secreted by the microbes, and the hydrolysis products are taken up and metabolized. Enzymatic activities include hydrolysis/oxidation/hydroxylation, resulting in cleavage of the polymer chains into oligomers and monomers. Enzymes that degrade the high-molecular weight polymers of PET and ester-based PU are known and details of their activities have been characterized. However, to date, no specific enzymes with the ability to biodegrade PE, PS, PP, or PVC have been well characterized, and the mechanisms of degradation the covalent bonds in carbon backbone petro-polymers are currently unknown. Thus we have chosen PET.

Polyethylene terephthalate is one of the major synthetic petro-plastics that is produced in very large amounts globally (Mohanan et al., 2020). PET is used in a wide-variety of applications, such as in manufacturing bottles, containers, textile fibers, and films. Although most biodegradable plastics are polyesters, PET, which is also a polyester, but is considered to be recalcitrant to biodegradation (Marques-Calvo et al., 2006). 
<br><br>
However, several microorganisms capable of metabolizing these polymers have been identified in recent years. Enzymes specifically associated with depolymerization of PET and ester-based PU have been identified and intensively studied, while enzymes that effectively depolymerize PE, PP, PS, and PVC have not yet been identified and characterized (Mohanan et al., 2020).
<br><br>
This is especially when the bacterium <i>Ideonella sakaiensis</i> 201-F6, our hero, was discovered in 2016. This bscterium is able to depolymerize PET polymers and utilize the terephthalate subunits as a carbon and energy source for metabolism and growth (Yoshida et al., 2016). Furthermore, researchers at the University of Portsmouth have discovered that mixing PETase with a second enzyme called MHETase has created an “enzyme cocktail” that degrades PET plastic at 6 times the rate it did before (Knott et al., 2020).
        </p>

        <h3>Mechanism of PET biodegradation</h3>
        <p>Yoshida et al. (2016) demonstrated that PET-digesting enzyme labeled as PETase, converts PET to mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), with minimal amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA as secondary products. Another enzyme, MHETase (MHET-digesting enzyme), further hydrolyzes MHET into the two monomers, TPA and EG. The metabolism of EG and its derivatives has resulted in different oxidation products such as glycolaldehyde, glyoxal, glycolate, and glyoxylate, which have a variety of value-added applications (Sajtos, 1991; Yue et al., 2012).

PETase, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase or PET-digesting enzyme; BHET, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid; MHET, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid; TPA, terephthalic acid; EG, Ethylene glycol.
        </p>
        <br><br><i>Ideonella sakaiensis</i> adhere to PET surface and use a secreted PET hydrolase (PETase) to degrade the PET into mono(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (MHET), a heterodimer composed of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol. The PETase also degrades PET into another intermediate known as Bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), BHET can be converted into MHET after PET hydrolysis  (Puspitasari et al., 2021). 
        <br><br>The <i>I. sakaiensis</i>PETase functions by hydrolyzing the ester bonds present in PET with high specificity. The resulting MHET is then degraded into its two monomeric constituents by a lipid-anchored MHET hydrolase enzyme, or MHETase, on the cell's outer membrane. The monomeric constituents such as ethylene glycol is then taken up and used by I. sakaiensis and many other bacteria. The other constituent; terephthalic acid, a more recalcitrant compound, is imported into the I. sakaiensis cell via the terephthalic acid transporter protein. Once in the cell, the aromatic terephthalic acid molecule is oxidized by terephthalic acid-1,2-dioxygenase and 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase into a catechol intermediate. The catechol ring is then cleaved by PCA 3,4-dioxygenase before the compound is integrated into other metabolic pathways (e.g. TCA cycle). As a result, both of the molecules derived from the PET are used by the cell to produce energy and to build necessary biomolecules. Eventually, the assimilated carbon may be mineralized to carbon dioxide and released into the atmosphere (Yoshida et al., 2016).
        <br><br>The genetic mechanism for the pathways enabling EG metabolism has been well demonstrated in <i>P. putida</i>. <i>P. putida</i> strain JM37 was able to utilize EG as a sole source of carbon and energy. The most relevant pathways related to the degradation of the monomer ethylene glycol are the acetaldehyde/ethanol pathway and the glyoxylic acid pathway. The glyoxylic acid pathway is commonly studied in the <i>Pseudomonas</i> genus as many species such as <i>P. putida</i> are known to be highly capable of degrading polyethylene in aquatic environments (Mückschel et al., 2012)
